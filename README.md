# OpenUTAU Italian Dictionary
Italian Dictionary for [OpenUTAU](https://github.com/stakira/openutau), based on the Italian CMU Sphinx Dictionary found [here](https://sourceforge.net/projects/cmusphinx/files/Acoustic%20and%20Language%20Models/Italian/), albeit with some adjustments.

This dictionary works with my Italian Syllable-based Phonemizer.

## Download instructions
Please place the ``cmudict_it.txt`` file in the ``Dictionaries`` folder of your OpenUTAU install. If it doesn't exist, make it.

Apologies for any errors in the file! I'll try my best to fix them. Feel free to submit merge requests if necessary. This also goes for words that you feel are missing. Feel free to add any!
